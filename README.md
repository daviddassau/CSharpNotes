# C Sharp Notes

## This is where I will keep my general notes on C#

#### Getting Started
- Each class in C# is a member of what's called a "namespace"
- When writing `Console.Write();` and `Console.WriteLine();` the difference is simple:
  - `Console.Write();` will display whatever is in the parenthesis
  - `Console.WriteLine();` will do the same, but will also append a new line at the end of the text
