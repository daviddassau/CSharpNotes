# C Sharp Notes

## This is where I will keep my general notes on C#

#### Getting Started
- Each class in C# is a member of what's called a "namespace"
- When writing `Console.Write();` and `Console.WriteLine();` the difference is simple:
  - `Console.Write();` will display whatever is in the parenthesis
  - `Console.WriteLine();` will do the same, but will also append a new line at the end of the text

#### Language Fundamentals
- C# is a strict object-oriented language
- All values are stored as objects, and an object is an area of memory that stores data and behaviors
- Objects in C# are instances of things called `classes` and `structures`
- A `method` is just like a function in a non-object-oriented language. It's a member of a classes and structures.
