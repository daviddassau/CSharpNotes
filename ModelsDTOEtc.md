### DTO
Stands for `Data Transfer Object`
- We use them to keep the internal modeling of your data from your database separate from the external view of your data from the user's standpoint.

### Models
I have this C# object, and it is a model of a db table,
- Model's are usually a 1 to 1 relationship.
